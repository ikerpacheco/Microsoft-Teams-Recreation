# Microsoft-Teams-Recreation

C Program recreating the behaviour of the well-know communication tool Microsoft Teams.

NOTE: It doesn't have a graphical representations, it's a terminal project, recreating the functionality of a Server, Client, Protocol and all the commands.

In order to execute the code:
- You will need to install "make".
- Clone the repository.
- Go into the directory and type the command "make" in the terminal.
- A executable will be created, execute it.

I recommend typing "-h" in order to see some help.
